#### Project Description & Basic Structure

In this application, the user is able to manipulate data in a SQL database, specifically three databases:

1. Employees - *contains a "title" that is a member of the "roles" database*
2. Roles - *each role is associated with a member of the "departments" database*
3. Departments

The user is first presented with the following options:

The user can select View Employees, Roles, or Departments and a table will be displayed in the terminal displaying detailed user-inputted information from the chosen database, as pictured below:

The user can select to a new employee, a new department, or a new role. This will prompt the user to fill in details which will then be added to the corresponding database.
